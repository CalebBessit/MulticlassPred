# CSC4025Z: AI Assignment 2 - Spotify Data

* Run `training.py` (after updating the `NUM_CLASSES` parameter) to train using a specified number of classes.
* `utils.py` has some helper functions for loading data and relabelling it where necessary. I have some experiments that I plan on doing with that. For instance, predicting the genre, encoding the artist name and analysis to reduce the number of features.
